## Introducing, You-tify!

This was a submission for the SB Hacks VII Hackathon. Our Devpost can be found here. (link to come later)

## Inspiration

Dylan recently started learning Python a month ago and, while coding, he often turned on music on Spotify. Recently, he has been listening to some game soundtracks. Unfortunately, Spotify's selection of game music is sorely lacking! He created a YouTube playlist and found a far better selection of more YouTube-exclusive songs and remixes. However, he wanted to also import his previous Spotify playlist onto that same platform.

But importing his large, 50+ song would be tedious! He also was interested in learning how to use a Web API as well. The perfect solution? Utilize Spotify and YouTube APIs to accomplish this task! Thus, the idea for You-tify was born, with Dylan, Jennifer, Thomas, and Vince attempting to make it a reality during SB Hacks VII.

## What it does

You-tify takes in a public Spotify URL and, after giving the program access to your account, creates a playlist of the same songs!

## How we built it

Dylan and Jennifer handled the backend.

Thomas and Vince worked on the frontend.
