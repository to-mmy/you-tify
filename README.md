## Introducing, You-tify!

This was a submission for the SB Hacks VII Hackathon. Our Devpost can be found here. (link to come later)

## Inspiration

Dylan recently started learning Python a month ago and, while coding, he often turned on music on Spotify. Recently, he has been listening to some game soundtracks. Unfortunately, Spotify's selection of game music is sorely lacking! He created a YouTube playlist and found a far better selection of more YouTube-exclusive songs and remixes. However, he wanted to also import his previous Spotify playlist onto that same platform.

But importing his large, 50+ song would be tedious! He also was interested in learning how to use a Web API as well. The perfect solution? Utilize Spotify and YouTube APIs to accomplish this task! Thus, the idea for You-tify was born, with Dylan, Jennifer, Thomas, and Vince attempting to make it a reality during SB Hacks VII.

## What it does

You-tify takes in a public Spotify URL and, after giving the program access to your account, creates a playlist of the same songs!

## How we built it

Dylan and Jennifer handled most of the backend.

Thomas and Vince worked on the frontend.

## Challenges we ran into

Dylan: I have never worked with any Web APIs before, so it was an interesting challenge familiarizing myself with the YouTube data documentation in such a limited time. Additionally, figuring out OAuth 2 made this far more difficult as well. I also used this hackathon as an opportunity to learn VS Code (I've only used PyCharm for Python) and introducing myself to Git/GitHub to collaborate with a team on future projects.

Jennifer:

Thomas:

Vince: I got stuck on the very beginning for 3 hours trying to install flask.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Dylan: After struggling to figure out how to successfully authorize myself after a couple hours of getting frustrating errors, making my first ever API call was incredibly satisfying. 

Jennifer:

Thomas:

Vince: Im proud that I went from knowing nothing about flask at the beginning of the hackathon to knowing a little more about flask at the end.

## What we each learned

Thomas:

Vince: The most valuable thing I learned from this Hackathon was how to use git hub.  I can do the basics now!  (Thanks Tommy)
